Deploy Workloads with Maximum Scale, Simplicity, and Security
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) for monorepo management. The Go API also has its local development
> workflows using Make in the API directory. For both web and API, you can check the flags to see the required runtimes
> needed to work with the repository before cloning locally.

# Quick Start
To run all apps in development mode you can use pnpm below
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
### Further Documentation
> [!NOTE]
> The plan is for both API and Web to maintain separate documentation in the current directories 
> and links will be provided here on this page that leads to them when it's done.

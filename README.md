A tiny container as a service platform

## Architecture

```
internal/
├── domain/      # Business entities and rules
├── contracts/   # Interface definitions
├── service/     # Business logic orchestration
└── adapters/    # Interface implementations
```

## Design Patterns Used
- **Domain-Driven Design** - Business logic isolated in domain layer
- **Repository Pattern** - Data access abstracted via Store interface
- **Dependency Injection** - Services receive dependencies through constructors

## Getting Started
